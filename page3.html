            <article class="text-content">
                <p>A sluggish laptop can be incredibly frustrating, but in most cases, performance can be restored with simple upgrades and maintenance. Start by cleaning up your system: uninstall unused programs, clear temporary files, and limit startup applications using your system's task manager. Then focus on hardware improvements. Replacing a traditional hard drive with a **solid-state drive (SSD)** drastically improves boot and loading times. To upgrade, remove the back panel, locate your existing drive, and carefully swap it with the new SSD using compatible connectors. While you're inside, check the RAM slots—adding more memory can further improve speed, especially for multitasking or heavy software use. After reassembling, reinstall your operating system or clone your old drive. Finally, update all drivers, defragment if needed, and ensure adequate airflow by cleaning vents and fans. With just these steps, your old laptop will feel brand new.</p>

            <h2>Guide 2: Fix a Laptop That Won't Turn On</h2>
            
            <article class="text-content">
                <p>If your laptop won't power on, don't panic. In many cases, the issue is simple and can be fixed without professional help. Start by removing all external devices such as USB drives and peripherals, then disconnect the power adapter. If your laptop has a removable battery, take it out as well. Press and hold the power button for about 15 seconds to release any residual charge that might be preventing startup. After that, reconnect the power and try turning it on again.</p>
                <p>If your laptop still doesn't respond, it may be time to open it up for a closer look. Using a small screwdriver, carefully remove the bottom panel. Check the **RAM modules** first—loose memory is one of the most common reasons a laptop won't power on. Reseat the RAM by removing and reinserting it firmly into the slots. While inside, also inspect the connections for the storage drive and the battery cable to make sure everything is properly connected.</p>
                <p>If the laptop remains unresponsive, try testing with another power adapter, as a faulty charger can prevent the device from powering up. You should also inspect the charging port for any visible damage or looseness. In some cases, replacing the **CMOS battery** can resolve startup problems caused by corrupted BIOS settings. If none of these steps work, the issue could be related to a faulty power button or a damaged motherboard component. These parts can often be replaced with a bit of patience and the right tools, potentially saving your laptop from an expensive full replacement.</p>
