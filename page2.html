            <h2>Guide 1: Replace a Tablet Battery</h2>
            
            <article class="text-content">
                <p>If your tablet barely holds a charge, a new battery can make a world of difference. Start by turning off the device and removing any case or accessories. Insert a plastic prying tool between the back cover and screen, gently working around the edges until it releases. Never use metal tools—these can scratch or puncture the battery. Inside, locate the battery connector and unplug it from the motherboard. Use a plastic card to loosen adhesive under the battery, slowly lifting it free. Position the replacement battery, reconnect it firmly, and secure it in place with tape or adhesive strips. After closing the device, plug it into a charger to verify that it powers on and charges correctly. Allow it to fully charge before first use. A new battery can double your tablet's usable life.</p>

            <article class="text-content">
                <p>A frozen e-reader or unresponsive screen is a common issue and is often caused by a minor firmware glitch or a temporary loss of power. To start, hold down the power button for about 30 seconds to perform a force restart. This simple step can often bring the device back to life. If the screen remains frozen, connect the e-reader to its charger and leave it plugged in for at least an hour. In many cases, a completely drained battery can mimic a system freeze and prevent the screen from refreshing.</p>
                <p>If the device still doesn't respond after charging, you may need to perform a quick hardware reset. Carefully open the back cover using a plastic opening tool to avoid scratching or damaging the casing. Once inside, disconnect the battery connector for around ten seconds, then reconnect it. This resets the internal power circuit and can often restore normal operation. While you have the device open, check that all ribbon cables are securely connected to the mainboard, as a loose cable can also cause display or power issues.</p>
                <p>After closing the device, try restarting it again and perform a software update if available. Keeping your e-reader's firmware up to date and restarting it regularly helps prevent future freezes, improves stability, and extends the overall lifespan of the device.</p>

            <h2>Guide 3: Repair a Broken Button</h2>
            
            <article class="text-content">
                <p>Unresponsive buttons, like a tablet's power or volume control can often be repaired without replacing the entire device. Begin by powering off the device and removing any screws or clips securing the back panel. Locate the faulty button module on the circuit board; it's usually held by adhesive or tiny screws. Use tweezers to lift it out and clean the contact pads beneath with isopropyl alcohol to remove dirt or corrosion. Install a new button or switch component, ensuring it's aligned with the housing and that the tactile "click" feels right when pressed. Reassemble the device and test functionality before sealing it up. Replacing worn buttons not only restores usability but also prevents wear on internal circuits caused by forced pressing.</p>
