<p>Broken technology doesn’t have to go to waste. From cracked screens to laptops that won’t start, devices can often be repaired quickly and reliably. Handling repairs properly helps extend the life of your electronics and keeps them out of landfills.<br><br>
  Old or damaged hardware can also be responsibly recycled. Many components can be reused, and recycling reduces electronic waste, helping protect the environment and conserve valuable resources.</p>
