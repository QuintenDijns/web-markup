            <article class="text-content">
                <p>Finding the correct spare part is the foundation of every successful repair. Begin by locating your device's **model and serial number**—usually printed on a label, engraved on the frame, or listed in your settings under "About Device." Use this exact identifier when searching online, as small variations can make parts incompatible. Always compare connector shapes, screw layouts, and dimensions in product photos before ordering. Avoid generic listings with no brand or warranty information; instead, choose sellers with verified reviews and clear return policies. OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) or certified-compatible parts tend to fit perfectly and last longer. If available, download a service manual for your device to confirm part compatibility before purchase. A little research at this stage saves time, money, and frustration—and ensures your repair works flawlessly the first time.</p>

            <h2>Guide 2: How to Diagnose Problems</h2>
            
            <article class="text-content">
                <p>When a device stops working, accurate diagnosis is half the repair. Start with basic checks: ensure it's plugged in, the outlet works, and the power cable is intact. Observe any lights, beeps, or fan sounds—they can reveal whether power is reaching internal components. For laptops and desktops, remove the case and visually inspect for **burnt components, loose connectors, or bulging capacitors**. In phones or tablets, look for damaged charging ports, swollen batteries, or disconnected ribbon cables. Use a multimeter to test power flow through the charger and battery. If the device powers on but malfunctions, note the symptoms—random shutdowns often mean overheating or power failure, while flickering screens can indicate cable or GPU issues. Always unplug before touching internal parts, and use anti-static precautions to avoid damaging circuits. By learning to identify what's wrong first, you save time and avoid unnecessary part replacements.</p>

            <h2>Guide 3: Safe Hardware Upgrades</h2>
            
            <article class="text-content">
                <p>Upgrading hardware is one of the most rewarding ways to extend your device's lifespan—but safety comes first. Always begin by backing up important data and powering off your device completely. Disconnect from power and press the power button once to discharge static energy. Ground yourself using an **anti-static wrist strap**, and work on a clean, flat surface. Open your laptop, desktop, or device case carefully, keeping track of screws and cables. Before installing new hardware—such as RAM, SSDs, or graphics cards—consult your manufacturer's manual to confirm compatibility. Align components gently without forcing them into place, and ensure all connectors are fully seated. After reassembly, reconnect power and perform a test boot to verify that the system recognizes the new hardware. Finally, update your BIOS or drivers to ensure full performance. Following these steps ensures safe, reliable upgrades without damaging delicate electronics.</p>
