            <article class="text-content">
                <p>A cracked or shattered screen doesn't have to mean the end of your phone. You can replace it yourself with patience and the right tools. Begin by powering off the device completely and removing the SIM tray. Warm the screen edges gently using a hair dryer or low-heat gun to soften the adhesive that holds the glass in place. Avoid excessive heat—too much can damage internal components. Use a suction cup and plastic prying tool to lift one corner of the glass slowly, then work your way around the frame. Once lifted, disconnect the display and digitizer cables carefully from the motherboard. Clean any leftover adhesive from the frame and align your new screen before reconnecting. Press down firmly around the edges and test the screen for responsiveness and brightness before sealing it completely. Finish by reinstalling the SIM tray and cleaning the screen with a microfiber cloth.</p>

            <h2>GUIDE 2: FIX BATTERY DRAIN</h2>
            
            <article class="text-content">
                <p>If your phone battery dies quickly or struggles to hold a charge, there are a few things you can try before replacing the entire device. Begin by checking for software-related causes. Reduce your screen brightness, turn off background app refresh, and disable Bluetooth and location services when you're not using them. It's also a good idea to check your battery usage settings to identify any apps that might be draining too much power. Making these simple adjustments can often help extend your battery life significantly.</p>
                <p>If the problem continues, the issue might be with the battery itself. In that case, you can try replacing it. First, power off your phone completely. Depending on the model, you'll need to open the back cover or carefully remove the screen. Once opened, gently disconnect the battery connector from the logic board using a plastic spudger—avoid using metal tools to prevent damage. Lift the old battery out carefully, taking extra care if it's glued down. When the old battery is removed, place the new one in the same position, reconnect the cable, and secure it with adhesive strips.</p>
                <p>After reassembling your phone, it's important to calibrate the new battery. Charge it to 100%, then let it drain until it's almost empty. Finally, charge it back to full again. This process helps the phone accurately measure battery capacity and ensures better long-term performance and reliability.</p>

            <h2>GUIDE 3: REPAIR A FAULTY CHARGING PORT</h2>
            
            <article class="text-content">
                <p>If your phone no longer charges or only charges at certain angles, the charging port may be clogged, loose, or damaged. Start by inspecting the port under good lighting. Often, lint or dust buildup blocks the connection—use a can of compressed air or a wooden toothpick to clean it gently. If cleaning doesn't help, you'll need to replace the port. Power off your device, remove the back panel or screen, and disconnect the battery to avoid short circuits. Locate the small charging board, usually secured with screws near the bottom. Carefully detach ribbon cables and remove the old port assembly. Install a replacement part that matches your exact phone model, reconnect all flex cables, and secure it firmly in place. Test charging before fully reassembling. If the port still doesn't work, check the cable and adapter, or inspect for motherboard-level damage, which may require professional help.</p>
